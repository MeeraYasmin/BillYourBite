# Student Dashboard Feature Specification

## Feature Overview
**Feature Name:** Student Spending Dashboard
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

## Problem Statement
SASTRA students want to track their mess spending patterns over time and get insights into their eating habits and expenses to better manage their budget.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Display student's historical spending data
- [ ] Show weekly/monthly spending trends
- [ ] Provide meal frequency analysis
- [ ] Generate spending insights and recommendations
- [ ] Export spending reports

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance: Load dashboard data within 2 seconds
- [ ] Usability: Intuitive charts and visualizations
- [ ] Compatibility: Works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Security: Secure storage of student spending data
- [ ] Privacy: Data visible only to the respective student

## Design

### UI/UX Design
- Add "ðŸ“Š My Dashboard" tab in sidebar
- Use Streamlit charts for spending visualization
- Color-coded spending categories
- Interactive date range selection
- Student summary card at top
- Responsive layout for mobile viewing

### Student Data Considerations
- Store spending data with student registration number as key
- Implement data retention policy (e.g., 1 academic year)
- Ensure data isolation between students
- Secure data storage and retrieval

### Data Model Changes
```python
# New data structure for spending tracking
spending_data = {
    "reg_no": str,
    "name": str,
    "date": datetime,
    "week_type": str,
    "day": str,
    "meal_type": str,
    "dishes": list,
    "total_amount": float,
    "department": str,
    "year": str
}
```

### Technical Architecture
- Use `st.session_state` for temporary data storage
- Implement CSV-based persistence for spending history
- Create dashboard rendering functions
- Add data aggregation and analysis functions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Implementation
- [ ] Create spending data storage mechanism
- [ ] Implement basic dashboard layout
- [ ] Add spending history tracking

### Phase 2: Student Integration
- [ ] Integrate with existing student form
- [ ] Add data persistence after bill generation
- [ ] Implement student-specific data filtering

### Phase 3: Analytics & Visualization
- [ ] Add spending trend charts
- [ ] Implement meal frequency analysis
- [ ] Create spending insights generator
- [ ] Add export functionality

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish
- [ ] Test with multiple student profiles
- [ ] Validate data security and isolation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] User acceptance testing

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Test dashboard with sample spending data
- [ ] Validate student data isolation
- [ ] Test chart rendering and interactivity
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing
- [ ] Data persistence and retrieval testing
- [ ] Security testing for data access

## Security & Privacy Checklist
- [ ] Student spending data encrypted at rest
- [ ] Access control by registration number
- [ ] No cross-student data leakage
- [ ] Secure file operations for data storage
- [ ] Input validation for all dashboard inputs
- [ ] Data retention policy implemented

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard displays student-specific spending data
- [ ] Charts render correctly with real data
- [ ] Spending trends calculated accurately
- [ ] Data persists across sessions
- [ ] Mobile-friendly responsive design
- [ ] No performance degradation with historical data
- [ ] Student data security maintained
- [ ] Export functionality works correctly
