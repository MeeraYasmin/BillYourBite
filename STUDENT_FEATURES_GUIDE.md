# Student Features Integration Guide

## ðŸŽ“ Student Information Features in BillYourBite

### Current Implementation
The app now includes comprehensive student information management:

- **Student Form**: Collects name, registration number, department, and year
- **Form Validation**: Ensures data quality and completeness
- **Personalized Bills**: Student info included in bill summaries and downloads
- **Secure Handling**: Privacy-compliant data management

### Key Components

#### 1. Student Information Form
```python
def render_sidebar(menu):
    st.sidebar.header("ðŸŽ“ Student Information")
    with st.sidebar.form("student_form"):
        name = st.text_input("Full Name", placeholder="Enter your name")
        reg_no = st.text_input("Registration Number", placeholder="e.g., 123456789")
        # ... validation and submission
```

#### 2. Data Validation
- Name: Must be non-empty, minimum 2 characters
- Registration Number: Alphanumeric format required
- Department: Predefined SASTRA department list
- Year: Roman numerals I-V

#### 3. Security Features
- Input sanitization for all student data
- No logging of personal information
- Secure file naming for downloads
- Session-based data management

### Development Guidelines

#### When Adding Student-Related Features:
1. **Follow Privacy Guidelines**: Use minimal data collection
2. **Implement Validation**: Always validate student inputs
3. **Secure File Operations**: Sanitize filenames and paths
4. **Test Security**: Use the Student Data Security hook

#### Kiro IDE Integration:
- **Auto-Testing**: Save `app.py` to trigger comprehensive validation
- **Security Review**: Run "Student Data Security Check" hook
- **Code Review**: Enhanced review includes student data handling

### Available Hooks for Student Features:
1. **test-app-on-save**: Validates student form functionality
2. **student-data-security**: Reviews privacy and security compliance
3. **student-data-migration**: Helps with data structure updates
4. **code-review-assistant**: Includes student data handling review

### Future Enhancements (Specs Available):
- **Student Dashboard**: Track spending patterns and insights
- **Nutrition Information**: Enhanced with student dietary tracking
- **Meal Planning**: Personalized meal recommendations

### Best Practices Checklist:
- [ ] Student data validation implemented
- [ ] Privacy guidelines followed
- [ ] Secure file naming used
- [ ] No sensitive data logging
- [ ] Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- [ ] Responsive design maintained
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verified

### Testing Student Features:
```bash
# Use Kiro hooks to test:
# 1. Save app.py (auto-triggers validation)
# 2. Run "Student Data Security Check"
# 3. Run "Performance & UX Review"
# 4. Run "Code Review Assistant"
```

### Common Issues & Solutions:
1. **Form Rerun Issues**: Use `st.form()` to prevent constant reruns
2. **Data Persistence**: Use `st.session_state` appropriately
3. **File Naming**: Sanitize student info in filenames
4. **Validation Feedback**: Provide clear error messages
